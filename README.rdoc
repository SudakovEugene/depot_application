I wrote this online store while doing some exercises from the
“Agile Web Development with Rails 4” book. The store includes:
a catalog, shopping cart, RSS channel Atom, the ability to create an order which
is followed by an automatic notification via email regarding your order,
authentication of users and authorization for administrators with significantly
greater rights than regular users have. It should look like https://time-is-meow.herokuapp.com
For login as admin use next: Login: Test; Password: Test.
